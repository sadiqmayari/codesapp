## Core Patterns

### API Response Shape
All API endpoints return this shape:
```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  data: T | null,
  message: string,
  meta?: {
    page?: number,
    limit?: number,
    total?: number
  }
}
```

### Tenant Scoping Pattern
Every service method that touches the DB receives `companyId` as its first argument:
```typescript
// CORRECT
async getContacts(companyId: number, filters: FilterDto) {
  return this.prisma.contact.findMany({
    where: { company_id: companyId, deleted_at: null, ...filters }
  });
}

// WRONG — never do this
async getContacts(filters: FilterDto) {
  return this.prisma.contact.findMany({ where: filters }); // missing company_id!
}
```

### Guard Execution Order
```
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, TenantGuard, PlanGuard)
```
Guards execute left to right. TenantGuard attaches `req.companyId`. PlanGuard reads `req.companyId` to check limits.

### EncryptionService Usage
```typescript
// Before saving to DB
const encrypted = this.encryptionService.encrypt(plainText);
await this.prisma.shopifyIntegration.create({ data: { access_token_encrypted: encrypted } });

// Before using in API call
const plain = this.encryptionService.decrypt(record.access_token_encrypted);
```

### Job Queue Pattern (MySQL-backed)
No Redis. All async jobs use the `jobs` table with a polling worker:

```typescript
// Enqueue a job
await this.jobQueueService.enqueue('broadcast', { broadcastId, contactId }, { delayMs: 0 });

// Register a worker (done once in module init)
this.jobQueueService.registerWorker('broadcast', async (payload) => {
  await this.processBroadcastJob(payload);
}, 3); // concurrency 3
```

**Poller design:**
- `setInterval` every 2000ms
- `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — safe for single-process and future multi-process
- Lease: `locked_until = NOW() + 30s` (renewed by worker on long jobs if needed)
- Retry backoff: 60s → 300s → 1800s (attempts 1 → 2 → 3, then status = `failed`)
- Queue names: `'broadcast'` | `'webhook'` | `'message'`

### In-Process Cache (node-cache)
```typescript
// Set with TTL
this.cache.set(`subscription:${companyId}`, subscriptionData, 300); // 5min

// Get
const cached = this.cache.get<SubscriptionData>(`subscription:${companyId}`);
if (cached) return cached;
```

### Socket.io Room Convention
```typescript
// Join room on connection
socket.join(`company:${companyId}`);

// Emit to all agents in a company
this.server.to(`company:${companyId}`).emit('message.received', payload);
```

### Media File Path Convention
```
/storage/media/{company_id}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{uuid}.{ext}
```

### Soft Delete Convention
Tables with soft delete have `deleted_at DateTime?`.
All queries must include `where: { deleted_at: null }` unless intentionally querying deleted records.

## Database Decisions
- Used `jobs` table (MySQL) instead of Redis/BullMQ for the job queue — Hostinger shared hosting does not support Redis; MySQL polling with `SKIP LOCKED` achieves the same reliability
- Used `node-cache` for in-process caching — single Node.js process on Hostinger, so in-process cache is safe and avoids Redis dependency
- `messages` table indexed on `(conversation_id, timestamp DESC)` for inbox query performance
- `usage_metering` uses a `UNIQUE INDEX (company_id, period)` so upserts are safe
- Auth: httpOnly cookie for refresh token (not localStorage) — XSS-safe
- Access token stored in JS memory only (not localStorage) — XSS-safe
- Prisma middleware uses `AsyncLocalStorage` from `node:async_hooks` for tenant context injection

---

## Module Decisions
- Auth uses httpOnly `Secure; SameSite=Lax` cookie for refresh token
- Access token kept in React memory (JS variable), not localStorage
- Axios interceptor handles 401 → call `/auth/refresh` → retry original request
- Socket.io gateway lives in inbox module (Phase 2), not a shared module
- JobQueueService runs inside the main NestJS process — no separate worker files or processes
- CacheService TTL: subscription data 5 min, analytics data 5 min
- Super admin IP whitelist bypassed in `NODE_ENV=development`
- Response headers use `X-CodesApp-*` prefix (not X-ChatCode-*)

---

## Known Limitations
> Record things that are intentionally simplified for v1

- 2FA is scaffolded but not enforced in v1
- One WhatsApp number per company (multi-number is Phase 2)
- No file preview for documents in inbox (show download link only)
- Broadcast throttle is fixed at 10 msg/sec (configurable in Phase 2)
- In-process cache (`node-cache`) is lost on process restart — acceptable for TTL'd data

---

## Third-Party API Notes
> Record any quirks discovered during integration

### Meta WhatsApp Cloud API
- Media URLs from Meta expire in ~10 minutes — download immediately on receipt
- 24hr customer service window: after expiry only template messages allowed
- Webhook verification: respond to GET with hub.challenge within 5 seconds
- Message status webhooks arrive separately from message webhooks

### Shopify
- Webhook HMAC header: `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256`
- Verify using `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, not the API secret
- Always respond 200 within 5 seconds or Shopify retries
- Register raw body parser for `/integrations/shopify/webhook` BEFORE global body parser

---

## Inbox real-time event reference (Phase 2)

All events scoped to room `company:{companyId}`. Client must connect with
`socket.io-client` passing `auth.token` (or `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
header) and `transports: ['websocket', 'polling']`.

### Server → client
| Event | Payload | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.online` | `{ userId }` | Socket connect (after JWT verify) |
| `agent.offline` | `{ userId }` | Socket disconnect |
| `message.received` | `{ message, conversationId, contactId, isNewContact }` | `MetaWebhookService` worker |
| `message.sent` | `{ message }` | `InboxService.sendMessage` |
| `message.status` | `{ messageId, status }` | `MetaWebhookService` status updates |
| `message.read.bulk` | `{ conversationId, readBy, readAt }` | `mark.read` event or `POST /mark-read` |
| `conversation.assigned` | `{ conversationId, userId }` | `InboxService.assign` |
| `conversation.updated` | `{ conversationId, status?, addedLabel?, removedLabel? }` | label/status mutations |
| `typing.start` / `typing.stop` | `{ conversationId, userId }` | Client-originated |
| `agent.viewing` / `agent.left` | `{ conversationId, userId }` | Client-originated, used for collision detection |
| `broadcast.progress` | `{ broadcastId, sent, failed, total, status? }` | `BroadcastWorker` every 25 jobs + on completion |

### Client → server (subscribed)
- `typing.start` / `typing.stop` — broadcast to room
- `agent.viewing` / `agent.left` — collision detection
- `mark.read` — server updates `read_at` + `read_by_user_id` then broadcasts `message.read.bulk`

### Authentication
`WsJwtGuard.authenticate()` is called in `handleConnection()` so unauthenticated
sockets are disconnected at handshake — not deferred to first event. Inside the
guard, JWT secret falls back to the insecure placeholder string only when
`JWT_SECRET` is missing (matches `JwtStrategy` behavior so dev still works).

---

## Broadcast throttle implementation (Phase 2)

`BroadcastsService.dispatch()` enqueues per-contact `'broadcast'` jobs with
`delayMs = index * 100`. With worker concurrency=3, this yields ~10 messages
per second per broadcast (and per company, since each company has its own
broadcasts and worker pool is shared globally — total throughput at the
process level is capped by concurrency, not by the spacing).

Status flow:
- `draft` → `sending` on `/send` after dispatch enqueues all jobs
- `scheduled` → `sending` when the single scheduler `dispatch` job fires at `run_at`
- `sending` → `completed` when `sent_count + failed_count >= total`
- Any state ≤ `sending` → `cancelled` via `/cancel` (deletes pending jobs by
  `JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.broadcastId')`)

Delivered / read counts are bumped by `MetaWebhookService.handleStatus()`
when it sees a status webhook for a message whose `broadcast_id` is set.

Worker progress emit: every 25 completed jobs the worker emits
`broadcast.progress` to the company room. On completion it emits one final
event with `status: 'completed'`.

---

## Bot engine — fire_webhook handoff to Phase 3

`BotEngineService.runForMessage()` is invoked by `MetaWebhookService` after
the inbound message is persisted. Action types:

- `reply_template` / `send_text` → calls `InboxService.sendMessage` (re-uses
  24hr-window enforcement and DB persistence).
- `assign_agent` → updates `conversations.assigned_user_id` only if it is
  currently unset (so manual assignment is never overwritten).
- `apply_tag` → merges into `contacts.tags` JSON array; no-op if already present.
- `fire_webhook` → **stub for Phase 3**. Enqueues a `'webhook'` job with payload:
  ```json
  {
    "event": "keyword.triggered",
    "webhookEndpointId": <int>,
    "data": { "companyId", "conversationId", "messageId" }
  }
  ```
  No worker is registered for the `'webhook'` queue in Phase 2 — jobs stay
  `pending` until the outbound webhook module (Phase 3) registers its worker.

Active-bot cache: `bots:active:{companyId}` (TTL 60s, via `CacheService`).
Invalidated on every POST/PATCH/DELETE/toggle bot mutation.

---

## Cross-module forward references (Phase 2)

- `InboxModule ↔ BotsModule` — `InboxModule` imports `BotsModule` for
  `BotEngineService`; `BotsModule` imports `InboxModule` for `InboxService`.
  Both use `forwardRef(() => ...)` in both `imports` and constructor
  `@Inject(forwardRef(...))` to break the cycle.
- `InboxGateway` is exported by `InboxModule` so `BroadcastWorker` can emit
  `broadcast.progress` to the company room without duplicating socket logic.
